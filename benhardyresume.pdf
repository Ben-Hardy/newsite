	\item[Plate:] { Plate is a command line template file creation utility designed to allow the user to quickly begin working on a file or testing an installation of a compiler or interpreter. It currently provides simple "Hello World"-style templates in 26 different languages/file types, can provide basic makefiles for C and C++ programs and can create project file structure for several project types. Plate is available at \textit{\href{https://github.com/ben-hardy/plate}{https://github.com/ben-hardy/plate}}.}
	\item[EAP GUI Design Editor:] { A group project for my Graphical User Interfaces course \(CMPT 381\), EAP is a JavaFX program used to quickly sketch out rough ideas for GUIs for a website or application. It is designed to be used almost exclusively with the mouse in order to keep usage simple since the program is intended to be used by non-programmers. My main focus on this project was implementing the actual drawing in the application. }

		\item[Pedigree Chart] {\footnotesize Developed a program which will parse through a pedigree file and display a pedigree chart in the command line}
		\item[Factory Nail Rejection] {\footnotesize This program was simulating a factory which produced nails that had to be a very specific length, and if it wasn't, the program would reject it}
		\item[Calendar Program] {\footnotesize Given the time and date to display, the calendar program would display a simple calendar on the command line which took into account leap years}
		\item[Normal Distribution] {\footnotesize This program simulated the classic wheel of fortune blinko game where several thousand chip were statistially recorded and displayed as they dropped into a board filled with pegs}
		\item[RSA Encryption] {\footnotesize Developed an application which utilized the RSA encryption method to encrypt and decrypt messages}
